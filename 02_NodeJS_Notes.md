**History of Nodejs**

Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance applications.

**io.js** was a fork of Node.js that emerged in 2014, focusing on faster releases and new features. In 2015, io.js merged back into the Node.js project, leading to the current version of Node.js.

In 2019, Node.js was officially adopted by the _OpenJS Foundation_, which is part of the Linux Foundation. This move aimed to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the Node.js project.

`echo` command used in the terminal is a command-line utility that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments. It is commonly used to display messages or to write text to files.

to print the variables in terminal, you can use the `echo` command followed by the variable name. For example, if you have a variable named `myVar`, you can print it in the terminal using:

```bash
echo $myVar
```

adding two variables in the terminal can be done using the `echo` command as well. For example, if you have two variables `var1` and `var2`, you can add them and print the result like this:

```bash
var1=5
var2=10
echo $((var1 + var2))
```
