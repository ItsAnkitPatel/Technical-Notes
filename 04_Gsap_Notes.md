**What is emotional design**

Emotional design is the practice of creating products that evoke specific emotions in users. It focuses on the user's feelings and experiences, aiming to create a connection between the user and the product. Emotional design can enhance user engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty. It involves understanding the user's needs, preferences, and emotions to create a product that resonates with them.

American psychologist **Donald Norman**, in his book "Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things," emphasizes the importance of emotional design in creating products that people love. He argues that products should not only be functional but also evoke positive emotions in users.

He discussed three levels of design:

1. **Visceral Design(Wow, that looks amazing)**: This level focuses on the immediate emotional response to a product's appearance and feel. It involves the initial attraction to a product based on its aesthetics, such as color, shape, and texture. Visceral design aims to create a strong first impression and evoke positive emotions through visual appeal.
2. **Behavioral Design(This feels intuitive)**: This level focuses on the usability and functionality of a product. It involves creating products that are easy to use, efficient, and effective in meeting the user's needs. Behavioral design aims to create a seamless user experience that enhances satisfaction and reduces frustration.
3. **Reflective Design**: This level focuses on the user's long-term emotional connection to a product. It involves creating products that resonate with the user's values, beliefs, and identity. Reflective design aims to create a lasting emotional bond between the user and the product, fostering loyalty and advocacy.
